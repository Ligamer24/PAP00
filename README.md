# Eternal Quest (2023)

> **Note:** This project was developed as my **Final Vocational Project (PAP)** for the IT Systems Course at Escola Secundária de Peniche.

## 📖 About the Project
**Eternal Quest** is a dynamic web application designed to gamify the school environment. Inspired by the book *Ready Player One* by Ernest Cline, the project creates a competitive and interactive experience for students and staff.

The main goal is to challenge users to interpret riddles (quatrains) to locate specific objects, services, or people within the school's ground floor.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Gamification:** Users solve 10 different riddles to progress in the game.
* **Dynamic Content:** Data is managed dynamically using JSON structures.
* **From Scratch:** developed entirely through coding, without the use of visual website builders, to ensure a deep understanding of web development fundamentals.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
This project was built using a component-based approach:
* **Languages:** JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3.
* **Data & Logic:** JSON, JSX.
* **Tools:** Visual Studio Code.

## 💡 Motivation
The primary objective was to demonstrate the technical skills acquired during my 3-year vocational course. By avoiding "drag-and-drop" tools, I focused on learning how frameworks and libraries work under the hood, preparing myself for a professional engineering environment.
