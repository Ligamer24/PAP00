## 📖 About the Project
**Eternal Quest** is a dynamic web application designed to gamify the school environment. Inspired by the book *Ready Player One* by Ernest Cline, the project creates a competitive and interactive experience for students and staff.

The application allows users to interpret riddles to locate specific objects or people within the school, tracking progress in real-time.
